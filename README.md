# 🖥️ Aashish MK — Terminal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my **Terminal-style personal portfolio website**.  
The website simulates a real command-line interface, allowing visitors to explore my profile by typing commands.

This project reflects my interest in **Computer Science**, **system-level thinking**, and **developer-focused UI design**.
